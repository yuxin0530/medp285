<h3>Biography</h3>

<p>I am <a href="http://yuxinfang.com" target="_blank">Yu Xin Fang</a> who is a lower junior studying emerging media at Hunter College. I was born on May 30, 2003, in Fuzhou, Fujian, China. In 2014, my family and I immigrated to the United States. I graduated from High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies in 2021 and attended Queens College. During my high school and time at Queens College years, I had no ideas about my major or career direction. At that time, I didn't know what I should learn or what I should do in the future. I had tried many different courses like early childhood education, nutrition, and corporate finance, but I chose media studies as my major. I ended up choosing media studies because of the inspiration from a co-worker when I worked at a milk tea shop. She is also a student at Hunter College, and I saw what she is doing with all those courses and found out I am also interested in things like Photoshop and filming. Therefore, I transferred to Hunter college and chose media studies as my major.</p>

<p>Outside of my academics, I worked and tried different part-time jobs such as a milk tea shop. Now I work at TESO Life, a Japanese fashion casual life product department store. I am trying all those different job that has nothing to do with my major just to enrich one's life experience and try to learn things from different perspectives from those works.</p>

My projects are designed to respond seamlessly to diverse devices and screen sizes, demonstrating a commitment to inclusive and accessible design.</blockquote>
