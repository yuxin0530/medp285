    <summary>I am Yu Xin Fang</summary>
	<p>A lower junior studying emerging media at Hunter College. I was born on May
    30, 2003, in Fuzhou, Fujian, China. In 2014, my family and I immigrated to
    the United States. I graduated from High School for Dual Language and Asian
    Studies in 2021 and attended Queens College. During my high school and time
    at Queens College years, I had no ideas about my major or career direction.
    At that time, I didn't know what I should learn or what I should do in the
    future. I had tried many different courses like early childhood education,
    nutrition, and corporate finance, but I chose media studies as my major. I
    ended up choosing media studies because of the inspiration from a co-worker
    when I worked at a milk tea shop. She is also a student at Hunter College,
    and I saw what she is doing with all those courses and found out I am also
    interested in things like Photoshop and filming. Therefore, I transferred to
    Hunter college and chose media studies as my major.</p>

  <p>
    Outside of my academics, I worked and tried different part-time jobs such as
    a milk tea shop. Now I work at TESO Life, a Japanese fashion casual life
    product department store. I am trying all those different job that has
    nothing to do with my major just to enrich one's life experience and try to
    learn things from different perspectives from those works.
